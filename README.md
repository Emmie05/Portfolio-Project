# Portfolio Project: Interactive Resistor Color Code Generator and GPA Calculator 🎓📏

This portfolio project is a web application toolkit that contains two main features: a GPA calculator and a resistor color code resistance generator. The goal of this project is to provide users with useful tools to calculate their GPA and determine resistor values based on color codes.

## Features

1. **GPA Calculator**
   - Allows users to input course names, select grades from a dropdown menu, and input credit hours (up to a maximum of 10).
   - Calculates the GPA based on a grading scale:
     - 'A': 4.0
     - 'B+': 3.75
     - 'B': 3.25
     - 'B-': 3.0
     - 'C+': 2.75
     - 'C': 2.5
     - 'C-': 2.0
     - 'D': 1.5
     - 'E': 1.25
     - 'F': 1.0

2. **Resistor Color Code Generator**
   - Users can select colors for each band from dropdown menus.
   - Displays a visual representation of the resistor with the selected colors.
   - Calculates and displays the resistance value.


## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different components.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Motivation & Vision 🌱
As both an Electrical & Electronic Engineering student and an aspiring Software Developer, I built this project to merge two of my key areas of interest: education and electronics. The GPA calculator is designed to help students like myself quickly assess academic performance, while the resistor color code generator addresses a common task in circuit design.

Initially, I faced challenges when integrating the React Router for seamless navigation between components, but overcoming this taught me valuable lessons in state management and routing.

Future iterations of the project could include additional calculators and a user dashboard for saving progress.
